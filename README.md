# Genetic-Algoritm-Employee-Assignation
The algorithm uses a Genetic Algorithm as the minimization solver.  
It currently works as a proof of concept.  The main objective function is the minimization of employee costs.

Data is import from Excel (Archive: Data.xls) and the results is export to Excel (Report.xls)

The Algorithmn uses Hard and soft constraints.
